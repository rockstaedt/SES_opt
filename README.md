# Smart Energy System - Optimization Group

This repository is used for our group project in the course Smart Energy System in the winter term 2020/2021.

The project focuses on the
- development of optimization approaches to carry out the short-term planning of power systems,
- study of the costs and benefits taken into account in short-term power systems planning to model different objectives,
- analysis of the physical characteristics of power system equipment to formulate their operational constraints
